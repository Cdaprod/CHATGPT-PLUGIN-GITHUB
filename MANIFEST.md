Sure, let's assume that your Flask application is running on your local machine at port 8000. You would then replace the `url` field in the manifest file with `http://localhost:8000/openapi.json`. 

Here's your updated manifest file:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "v1",
  "name_for_human": "GitHub Repo Manager",
  "name_for_model": "github_manager",
  "description_for_human": "Plugin to manage GitHub repositories, including creating and modifying files.",
  "description_for_model": "Plugin to manage GitHub repositories, including creating and modifying files.",
  "auth": {
    "type": "service_http",
    "authorization_type": "bearer",
    "verification_tokens": {
      "openai": "<your-openai-token>"
    }
  },
  "api": {
    "type": "openapi",
    "url": "http://localhost:8000/openapi.json",
    "is_user_authenticated": false
  },
  "logo_url": "https://example.com/logo.png",
  "contact_email": "<your-email-address>",
  "legal_info_url": "http://www.example.com/legal"
}
```

Remember to replace "<your-openai-token>", "<your-email-address>", and the URLs for "logo_url" and "legal_info_url" with your actual details.

This configuration means that your Flask application will need to host the OpenAPI definition at the endpoint "/openapi.json" on port 8000. This can be accomplished by configuring your Flask app accordingly.
